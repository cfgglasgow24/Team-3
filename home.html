        <h2>Information About Mental Health</h2>
        <p>It is true that mental health issues can impact anyone, and there are various factors that can contribute to this. 
            Environmental factors such as trauma, poverty, social isolation, and difficult childhood experiences can all play a significant role. 
            Additionally, disability is often a key factor in mental health challenges. It is important to be aware of these factors and to seek help when needed in order to maintain good mental health. 
            Our organisation contributes to increasing mental health awareness for individuals who are deafblind. specifically by following our future road map of networking between deafblind people and people who are learning tactile.</p>
